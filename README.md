# Rock Paper Scissors

## Description
My goal with building the Rock Paper Scissors project was to create a simple game that will keep track of your wins, losses and ties. The page opens with a prompt asking you to chose between R, P, or S then the program choses and you either win, lose or tie. 

# Installation
N/A
## Usage
To play, when the prompt opens chose an r, p, or s and push okay. The computer will then do the same. After you click okay an alert will appear to tell you if you won lost or tied. Once you push okay on that alert another alert will appear asking if you want to play again. If you do you can replay and if you don't push cancel. If you push cancel you will be told the final tallies of wins, losses, and ties.
